# amvstrm's API

amvstrm's API that powered [amvstrm](https://amvstr.me)

_Our official API is ``api.amvstr.me``_

## NOTICE

This API will be deprecated on __10th November 2024__ and we also making some changes that can break the website. Please consider trying the [new API](https://github.com/amvstrm/api-bun) that we have rewritten our code into Typescript and completely switched from Nodejs to Bun and Expressjs to Elysiajs. We are done with the JS code and the express frameworks.

## Usage

Our public APIs are hosted on the same free cloud provider and you should not blame us for why the API is unusable. 

The public API will only be used for TESTING & APP MODULE (miru-project for example). Self-host your own API if you do high-volume requests. 

All APIs will be rate-limited from 80 to 60 per minute, and you must provide a user agent to use the API. We will block the API that attempted to use our API for larger requests and log as much as possible. We have the right to do it and I don't want to deal with cloud providers.
